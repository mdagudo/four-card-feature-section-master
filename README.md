## My process

I kept it simple and didn't complicate things in the way the divs were positioned, so I just did it in an easy way and didn't add too much divs... UPDATE: I had to add that extra div in order to make my design better. I used flex instead of hard coding some margins and I added @media so it looks better and responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a challenge to practice. I'm getting more confident in every challenge.

### Continued development

I need to learn Mobile First design!!!

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helps me every time I code.
